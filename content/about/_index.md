I develop state-of-the-art models to advance applied and theoretical methods for ecology and environmental management. My research encompases a wide range of topics from big data analysis at both local and global scales to field and laboratory experiments on vertebrates and invertebrates in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems. I am particularly interested in understanding how organisms respond to changing climates and how their responses vary with time and space. I work at the interface of data science, climate change, macroecology, spatial modeling, uncertainty, and quantitative risk assessment to inform and guide the best scientific and management decision-making processes. 

As part of my academic journey, I have undertaken research on a diverse range of topics and organisms, including marine elasmobranchs, freshwater crayfish, and Australian grasshoppers. For my MSc thesis, I conducted a study on the [conservation status of the sawfish in Bangladesh](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aqc.2466). During my MPhil, I examined the [impacts of global climate change on freshwater crayfish](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ddi.12831), and how [uncertainty in global climate projections](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ddi.12936) affects climate change vulnerability assessments. For my PhD, I focused on understanding the [patterns of distribution and adaptive strategies of Australian grasshoppers in response to varying environmental conditions](https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/items/d6602761-b9e9-4dc1-b52d-e0ceb9bae69a). Additionally, I collaborated with my supervisors to create a [database](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.2fqz612sn) of Australian [grasshopper occurrences](https://doi.org/10.1111/aen.12628) from historic field survey notebooks spanning 54 years. I utilize various tools such as R, ArcGIS, Python, and high-performance computing systems for data analysis.

Recently, I successfully completed my PhD and several research contracts with esteemed research groups such as the [Climatic and Metabolic Ecology Lab](https://camel.science.unimelb.edu.au/) and the [Quantitative and Applied Ecology Group](qaeco.com) at the University of Melbourne. I am currently focusing on publishing the chapters of my thesis, while actively seeking out new opportunities in the academic and research fields.
