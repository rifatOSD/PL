Recently, we unveiled an article detailing a comprehensive dataset of historical grasshopper occurrences in Australia. This dataset, compiled from field notebooks, forms a chapter of my PhD thesis. Through this research, we were able to recover 8975 geographic coordinates for 477 distinct species of grasshoppers found in Australia. For more information on the background and methodology of this study, please refer to our original [article](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aen.12628) and the associated [blog post](https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/lockdown-field-trip-reveals-whereabouts-of-australian-grasshoppers) in Unimelb Pursuit.
